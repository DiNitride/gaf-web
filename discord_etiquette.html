                    <b>A guide to Discord speaking in the GAF Discord Voice channels without getting shouting at by DiNitride</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GAF Discord is a cesspool, a messy place of bad audio-gags, Hats making awful jokes, and various people being screamed at. That said, sometimes, people need to shut the fuck up.
                    Here's some general help to getting a balance between all out screaming at each other, while still getting good communication accross.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>A basic summary of this guide: Treat conversations on Discord like real life ones. Don't talk over each other constantly because it becomes a complete clusterfuck very quickly</b>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    These rules apply to everyone, except when someone higher rank than you shouts at you.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    1. If a channel is marked as private or a quiet room, either <br> A) Message whoever is in the channel on Steam/B.net/Discord and ask if it's okay to join<br>B) Join quietly, and wait for a good opportunity to speak (i.e. Don't join and scream your presence)
                    <br><br>
                    2. Talking over each other is naturally going to happen when we're fucking around, as it does in real life, however when we're in-game and calling, or sitting in a channel having general conversations, treat it like a real coversation. Don't talk over each other and wait until people have finished speaking.
                    <br><br>
                    3. The rank structure is there for a reason. Yes, you can bully and roast everyone on the server, but, usually higher ranks represent experience on the server. If you're a community member, a GAF member is above you. If you're GAF, Moderators and Admins are above you. Listen
                    to people as they usually know what they're talking about. Obviously, take the rank structure in context, GAF Member tells you to stop doing something because it's legitimately annoying / against rules or TOS, you listen.
