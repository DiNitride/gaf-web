                    <b>A guide to speaking in the GAF Discord Voice channels without getting shouting at by DiNitride</b>

                    GAF is a mess, a lot of screaming at each other, laughing and bullshit. That said, sometimes, people need to shut the fuck up.
                    Here's some general help to getting a balance between all out screaming at each other, while still getting good communication accross.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>#1 Treat conversations on Discord like real life ones. Don't talk over each other constantly because it becomes a complete clusterfuck very quickly</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>#2 Channels 1 & 2 are chilling channels - If you're hanging in Channel 1 or 2 playing games, it's all good, but if you're whole PUBG squad is shouting at each other while a few others are just trying to relax, hop into one of the game channels below. It's better for everyone and you can jump back when you're done.</b> - <i>Channels 1 and 2, The BBC Radio 4 Lounge, The Quiet Room and Mobile are all general hanging out channels. Playing games in there is no problem, but if people start joining to hang out and you're disrupting, be polite and hop somewhere else.</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>#3 Like it not, staff are staff, and while we generally spent most of our time shouting at each other, when a staff member is being staff, listen.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Simple as that
                    <br><br>
