      <p>
        GAF <i>sometimes</i> runs Arma 3 casual-milsim missions where we try and attempt something organised, fuck it up and inevitably end up on fire. That said, it's usually quite entertaining and the more numbers we can get, the more we can do. So if you're interested in fucking about with GAF in general, and enjoy Arma, come join us.

        We use a small modpack, and you will need the Task Force Radio plug-in installed on your Teamspeak Client. The modpack can be found <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=752928736">here.</a>

        We also have an Arma 3 Unit registered on the Arma website. Gonna be honest, fuck knows what it does, but it exists, so uh, <a href="https://units.arma3.com/unit/neverendinggaf">here it is.</a>
